### About Me

Hello! I'm **Chenyi Xu**, currently a third-year undergraduate at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I’m very fortunate to be advised by **Prof. Liqi Yan** at HDU, and since 2025 I’ve also been working closely with the **AGI Lab** at Westlake University under **Prof. Chi Zhang**.

My primary academic passion lies in **Computer Graphics** and **Embodied Intelligence**. I’m particularly interested in how we can make 3D content creation faster and more accessible, how embodied agents can better understand and navigate complex real-world (or augmented) environments, and how vision-language models can bridge perception and action more effectively.

I enjoy the full cycle of research — from reading papers and brainstorming ideas, to implementing prototypes, running ablation studies, and finally seeing something actually work (or fail in interesting ways). I believe that combining strong geometric understanding with modern foundation models opens up many exciting possibilities.

Outside of research, I’m quite active in a few hobbies that help me recharge and stay inspired:

- ♠️♥️ Playing **Mahjong** (especially Sichuan style) and various forms of **poker** — I love the mix of strategy, psychology, and social interaction  
- 🏔️ **Hiking** and **traveling** — I’ve been to quite a few beautiful places in China and hope to explore more internationally in the future  
- 🎧 Listening to **podcasts** on science, technology, history, psychology, and sometimes just random interesting stories  

These activities keep me curious, help me think from different angles, and remind me that life is more than just papers and deadlines.

I’m always glad to connect with people who work on graphics, embodied AI, vision-language models, or just want to chat about research life, games, travel experiences, etc. Feel free to reach out!

### News & Activities

- **November 2025**  
  Very excited that our paper **AR-Nav Benchmark** has been accepted to **AAAI 2026** as an **Oral** presentation! Huge thanks to all co-authors and especially to my advisor for the support throughout the project.

- **April 2025**  
  Joined the **PARK** project (University of Rochester) as a remote contributor. We built a web-based application that analyzes participants’ movements, speech, and facial expressions to help assess symptoms related to Parkinson’s disease.

- **June – September 2025**  
  Spent an unforgettable summer doing research at **AGI Lab, Westlake University**. Learned a tremendous amount from my advisor Prof. Chi Zhang and wonderful senior lab mates. Grateful for all the guidance, discussions, and late-night debugging sessions.

- **March 2025**  
  Received the **University First-Class Scholarship** for academic performance.

- **September 2024**  
  Awarded **Provincial First Prize** in the National College Students Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM).

### About

Hi! I'm a third-year undergrad passionate about graphics and embodied AI.

I enjoy turning ideas into working systems — whether accelerating 3D generation or building vision-language navigation agents.

Outside research, you can find me:
- ♠️ Playing **Mahjong** / **poker**
- 🏔️ **Hiking** or **traveling**
- 🎧 Listening to podcasts

Always happy to chat about research, tech, or a good game — reach out anytime!
